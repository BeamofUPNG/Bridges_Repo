# Bridges Summer School 2026 — Chaos Gods One-Page Site

This repository addition contains a single-page educational website about the four Chaos Gods (Khorne, Tzeentch, Nurgle, Slaanesh) prepared for Bridges Summer School 2026.

Files:
- `index.html` — Single page with sections for each Chaos God.
- `styles.css` — Simple stylesheet used by the page.

Notes:
- This is a fan-made educational summary. Warhammer 40,000 and related IP are owned by Games Workshop.
- If you want images, add them to an `assets/` directory and update `index.html` with `<img>` tags. Use appropriately licensed images or user-created artwork.
- To preview locally: open `index.html` in a browser or serve via a simple HTTP server, e.g.:
  - Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000` then open `http://localhost:8000/`

If you'd like me to commit these files to a branch in the repository and open a pull request, tell me:
- The branch name to use (default suggestion: `bridges-summer-2026-site`), and
- Whether you want me to open a PR and target branch (e.g., `main` or `master`).
I can then create the branch and push the files for you.
