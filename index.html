      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        In the fictional universe of Warhammer 40,000, Chaos is a powerful and corrupting force shaped by the emotions and desires of sentient beings. The four major Chaos Gods — Khorne, Tzeentch, Nurgle, and Slaanesh — each embody particular aspects of mortal thought and feeling and influence the galaxy in different ways.

    <section id="khorne" class="card">
      <h2>Khorne — The Blood God</h2>
      <p><strong>Domain:</strong> War, battle, bloodshed, and martial honor.</p>
      <p>
        Khorne is the embodiment of rage and violence. He values strength, combat skill, and direct action; his followers pursue warfare, slaughter, and personal glory in battle. Khorne is often depicted as furious and relentless — blood and skulls are common symbols associated with him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cultural note: Followers of Khorne often reject sorcery and subtlety, preferring brutal melee combat. The phrase "Blood for the Blood God!" is a well-known battle-cry associated with him.

    <section id="tzeentch" class="card">
      <h2>Tzeentch — The Changer of Ways</h2>
      <p><strong>Domain:</strong> Change, ambition, fate, schemes, and sorcery.</p>
      <p>
        Tzeentch represents change in all its forms: plots, inventions, mutations, and the flow of destiny. His followers prize knowledge, manipulation, and magic. Where Khorne acts with brute force, Tzeentch prefers intricate plans and arcane power.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cultural note: Tzeentch’s followers are often depicted as sorcerers, schemers, and those willing to embrace transformation — both mental and physical — to achieve their goals.

    <section id="nurgle" class="card">
      <h2>Nurgle — The Lord of Decay</h2>
      <p><strong>Domain:</strong> Decay, disease, endurance, and a twisted form of fertility/renewal.</p>
      <p>
        Nurgle personifies rot and pestilence, but also resilience and bitter affection. His followers accept decay and hardship as inevitable and find comfort in persistence. Nurgle’s grotesque gifts both destroy and sustain life in altered forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cultural note: Imagery associated with Nurgle often includes flies, pustules, and stubborn survivors who laugh in the face of despair.

    <section id="slaanesh" class="card">
      <h2>Slaanesh — The Dark Prince</h2>
      <p><strong>Domain:</strong> Excess, pleasure, perfection, sensation, and obsession.</p>
      <p>
        Slaanesh embodies excess and the pursuit of extreme sensation: beauty, perfection, lust, and artistic obsession can all fall under Slaanesh’s influence when taken to dangerous extremes. Followers seek experiences beyond ordinary limits and may become consumed by desire and vanity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cultural note: Slaanesh’s aesthetic is often lavish and alluring, but beneath the surface there is a predatory hunger for more — more sensation, more perfection.
      </p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Each of the four Chaos Gods reflects distorted aspects of mortal nature: violence (Khorne), change and cunning (Tzeentch), decay and resilience (Nurgle), and excess and desire (Slaanesh). In storytelling, they provide dramatic forces that challenge heroes and societies — a useful set of archetypes for exploring ethics, consequence, and the extremes of behaviour.
